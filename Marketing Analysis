The projects goal was to conduct a Marketing Analysis on a given dataset. We had to work with a messy dataset and also work around the behaviours of real life people.
One of witch was taking into account people who stay on page but are unactive. I had to create multiple advanced queries to gather data that actually actionable.
Feel free to take a look a the queries and analysis.
