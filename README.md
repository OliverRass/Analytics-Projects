# Analytics-Projects
A quick taste of my skills as a Data Analyst. Here you can find some of the projects I have completed at Turing College.

AB Testing - Analysing multiple campaigns that had different versions running during the same time period and identifying which one performed better.
An integral part of the project was also determening wether the findings where actually due to better performance or just by chance.

Looker Studio - Shows a dashboard created based on the popular Olist dataset.

Marketing Analysis - Analysis on the behaviours of customers on a company's website, to gain insights into how different marketing campaigns performed.

RFM - Analysing and identifying key customers based on their Recency, frequency and monetary score.

Retention, Cohorts and Churn - Analysing customer retention.
